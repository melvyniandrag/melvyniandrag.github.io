<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Came up fast and got the benz. My buddy says that this is a shitty rap line. I think it's brilliant
word play that relates climbing the socioeconomic ladder to scuba diving. In any event, this
blog post is about the perils and the glories of owning a 17 year old luxury car that was bought in rough
shape for only $1450.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="about-the-1450-2000-s500">
<h2>About the $1450 2000 S500</h2>
<p>This post would be better with pics and videos but I don't have them on my laptop and wont get on my desktop for a few days.</p>
<p>The beautiful, rust free 5-speed Red Ford Ranger developed a series of crippling problems faster
than they could be economically fixed. The straw that broke the camel's back was a loss of power and a loud noise when in gear.
I suspected the input shaft bearing, but who knows what it was. It started out only in second gear but then
slowly progressed to make the horrific noise in all gears. It wasn't a metallic or grinding sound so I figures it was something simpler.
Nevertheless between work and kids and friends and hobbies it didn't feel like spending time and money on
installing a new transmission in the car, so it was hastily sold to a guy up the block for $150 bucks.
I think it was a good deal, it had new calipers, pads, rotors, a windshield, alternator, struts,
tires, and the engine was still quiet and not leaking a drop of anything.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks I fought a mental battle between leasing/financing a new car and taking on debt or finding
an acceptable japanese car for a few thousand dollars that would keep me debt free. The only used car under 5k on Craigslist
was a 2000 S500 that had a slow leak in the front passenger side tire, a busted blower motor, a sunroof that wouldn't budge and a bald drivers side tire. The pictures online showed a license plate on the car and it was right up the road in a
nice town of kind people in Webster, NH. I figured there couldn't be anything wrong with it.</p>
<p>As soon as I bought the car I opened her up. I'd never owned a 300+ hp v8 car before. 30 seconds into ownership
the check engine light came on, it vibrated aggressively and lost power. I'd heard of misfires before but never experienced one.</p>
<p>I limped it home and researched what to do. This problem hadn't surfaced on the test drive I'd taken, the guy was nice enough and
seemed pretty transparent. We jacked the car up and I looked and ball joints and bearings. The rear suspension was a little rough
but this was a $1450 car that ran, had no leaks, and was quite comfy. I forgot to mention that the heated seats weren't working either
but that was not essential. Anyway, it seems a misfire can be caused mainly by a bag ignition system or
poor compression, probably from a blown head gasket. The cheap chinese scanner I had was showing misfires in cylinders
3 and 5 and also a code for a random misfire. I googled to find if 3 and 5 were adjacent in this engine, which might indicate a headgasket blown between them but couldn't find a straight answer online about the cylinder ordering. Of course the )(&#64;$&amp;Q($Q(WEFH at MB don't
release repair information so I couldn't find an official source to tell me which cylinder was which.</p>
<p>I guess all this didn't matter because the misfire resolved itself within  minutes. It would come back under aggressive information over the next few months, and to me this indicated a bad wire that was bending a certain way under load causing a misfire. Never got around to fixing it because
after manifesting itself several times in September the problem didn't come back (as of 03/18 ). I wanted to take the plugs out and look for fouling but didnt get around to starting this project for a few weeks while I debated buying the $30 wrench needed to pry the boots off the plugs (the plugs are so deep in the engine and at such an angle that you need a specially bent wrench to pry the boots off. Strike 2 agains MB in my book, after the absence of repair information. Eventually I managed to get a plug out and it looked fine but I was absolutely terrified to do anymore than that because they were kind of hidden behind other engine components an I knew my clumsy self would snap a plug head off and have to spend a fortune at the mechanic.
So the misfire was just ignored and to this day I just drive carefully.</p>
<p>Other problems have come up over time. The license plate lights didnt work when I bought the car ( forgot to mention that ). I got my trusy multimeter out and traced the wiring to a module under the seat, which it turns out is called the SAM (signal acquisition module). A used one on ebay is 1-2 hundred bucks. To have the shop order one from their guys and install it should cost about $800. There were a bunch of switches on the dash that didn't work anymore , and still don't, like the suspension adjustment button. I guess they might be controlled by the rear SAM as well. When I have a free weekend I'll probably swap it, but I'm just scared to death to touch anything in this high tech car because it is so damned finicky. I endedup just busting out the old bulb mounts (which were totally rusted and useless) and discreetly ziptieing some long-living hid flash lights in their place. No problems with the cops in 6 months and I've only had to replace batteries once. A more sophisticated alternative would be to run a parallel line around the tail lights to some replacement license plate bulbs. Voltage in parallel is constant so provided I could find something drawing the ~12V that the license plate bulbs drew, I could supply the same voltage to the license plate lights. But, as I've said, this damned car is so finicky and high tech. I just know it would have detected the extra current being drawn and freaked out. So it's just going to be flash lights until the SAM is replaced.</p>
<p>Another problem with the car I forgot to mention was that the wiper blade was bad wehn I bought it. The seller included a wiper but it didn't fit. Turns out that the S500 uses a clip that is wider that then clips you find on the blades at Autozone et. al. Another strike for fucking mercedes, why not use a standard wiperblade! The set of two cost me $65. Not the end of the world, but still quite pricey for wiper blades.</p>
<p>And yet another problem with the car when I bought it was that the passenger side HID bulb was burned out. I bought a $100 bulb which also burned out shortly after. I hadnt done the swap with gloves on though because I thought that people were just exaggerating when they
said that the oils from your hands could damage the bulbs. I subsequently bought a bunch of cheap korean bulbs and a $50 german bulb from Sanels auto store in Concord ( I really like the store! well stocked and personable people! ).I swapped the bulb again ( this time disconnecting the battery before touching the wires - I could have died!! I had no idea that there was so much voltage in this system until I accidentally found out it could have killed me ) and it was good for months. Then I swapped 2 bulbs at the same time because the korean bulbs were dimmer than the German bulbs. Now it's been a few more months without trouble, but you never know, it could come back.</p>
<p>When the first snow fell this winter the car was squirrely as all hell. I got stuck at the bottom of a big hill on my way to pick up Phoebe and had to fight for many tens of minutes to get up the hill - it was time for new tires. I knew the old ones weren't great, but I didn't realize just how awful they were until the snow came. (ALSO forgot to mentionthat the slow leaking tire wasn't a slow leaking tire, I had to buy a set of new rims because the front passenger rim was cracked and to get it welded would have cost ~$300. The rims were 18&quot; and I couldn't find a suitable cheap replacement 18&quot; pair. So I bought a set of 4 17&quot; rims with 2 good tires and 2 bad tires for $300 on CL from a guy who , interestingly enough, used to work at DEKA.). Those were the tires that were slipping. So I had to go to tire warehouse and buy a $500 set of snow tires. I've never had such a wonderful winter driving experience. Everyone should buy snow tires in winter.</p>
<p>Lastly, the car started to behave weird at speed, kind of drifting a bit. Turns out it was balljoints. The cost to repair the ball joints that were pressed into the knuckles was just shy of $600. The car was still a little drifty after that and made a bit of noise so I went to another shop and paid another 300 to have the front driver's side wheel bearing replaced. The wheel bearing may have been fine, but the ball joints were bad, I think, I don't know much about either. The ball joints had a bit of up and down play, which I don't think they are supposed to have but I'm not sure. The car started making a whirring noise while I was driving through Manhattan and the whirring was not related to braking. I guessed a wheel bearing and the shop was happy to replace the bearing - but they did tell me that some shield had been bent and I guess that's what was causing the whirring. I keep my tires areound 40 psi out of ignorance (the sidewall says max psi = 45 so I just put a bit less). The gas tank cover, however, says to put 29 in the front and 32 or so ( can't remember right now) in the back.  But I wonder how they would recommend a pressure, given that they don't know the tires I put on and don't know what rim size I have. Long story short, I don't know if a bit of up and down in the ball joint is okay. Each dust boot had a small cut in it which would permit dirt to enter. I wonder if the guys at the shop just put a cut in the ball joint dustboots so that eventually I'd need a repair. The very personable shop owner in Concord NH let me leave the shop with the knowledge that I'd be driving ~70 miles a day on what he called &quot;very worn&quot; ball joints - that made me thin kthey weren't that bad because a bad joint could kill me! In any event, the car has new ball joints and a new wheel bearing, my mind is at ease, and I have some maintenance receipts in case I decide to sell the car.</p>
<p>Another point I forgot to mention - the pneumatic door locks / trunk opener stopped working a few months ago. I had been just using the key to manually unlock the door but one time there was considerable resistance and I got scared that the car would get stuck locked, so I haven't locked it in months. There is likely a leak in the pneumatic pump thingy in the trunk or a hose has become unseated. Havent had time to check it out, so the car has just been unlocked. Thank god I'm not in Newark NJ.</p>
<p>Heated seats have never worked.</p>
<p>Driver side side-view mirror has some issue whereby it is tinted a bit orange and sort of gives a double reflection, I suspect there is a rear plate in it that is messed up. Kind of how there is a rear reflector in the rear-view mirror.</p>
<p>The car has alot of external rust.</p>
<p>I could say more but this should suffice for now. I've spent, all things considered, 3K or so on this car. I've had it since August or so, and when I bought it I was hoping to get at least 3 months out of the car. Guess I'm ahead now. Considering buying a replacement engine and tranny to keep in storage just in case. I guess my next car will be a honda or toyota, but this one is good.</p>
